# Fatty-Liver-Classification-and-Scaling-0-to-2-using-CNN
These are the codes for my project called " Fatty Liver Classification and Scaling: from 0 to 2 using CNN." In this project, I've created my own neural network and trained it with the images of the kidneys with the fat level scaling from 0 to 2. 

The difference of this project is that the network categorizes the images for their fat level it decreeses through the images we've trained. So, with each given new data to the network, the programme indicates which level of fatness the liver is categorized. 

I have used Tensorflow Keras and ImageDataGenerator to build this neural network. All data labeling is done with help of ImageDataGenerator.Convolutional neural network with max pooling as dense layers is used for building up the model. The enviroment for the project is "Jupyter Notebook".

The more data we train for the network, the higher accurence rates we get!

Pre-requisites:
The following are the pre-requisites for running the notebook on a local machine.

-Python3,Keras,PyTorch,Matplotlib,Numpy

#PLEASE DON'T POST THIS CODES AND THE PROJECT AS YOUR OWN. IF YOU HAVE ANY CONFIGURATIONS AND WORK DONE TO THE CODE, GIVE ME A CREDIT + REPOST PLEASE! THANK YOU!!
